### REST Clients

The Spring Framework provides the following choices for making calls to REST endpoints:

1. RestClient - synchronous client with a fluent API.
2. WebClient - non-blocking, reactive client with fluent API.
3. RestTemplate - synchronous client with template method API.
4. HTTP Interface - annotated interface with generated, dynamic proxy implementation
5. Open feign client - Declarative REST Client, Feign creates a dynamic implementation of an interface decorated
   with JAX-RS or Spring MVC annotations
