### HTTP interceptors

Introduction:

To intercept HTTP requests, use the web request API.
This API enables you to add listeners for various stages of making an HTTP request.

In the listeners, you can:

* Get access to request headers and bodies and response headers.
* Cancel and redirect requests.
* Modify request and response headers.

This article looks at three different uses for the webRequest module:

* Logging request URLs as they are made.
* Redirecting requests.
* Modifying request headers.

An example would include the following:

* The user is onboarded into the system by providing identification information.
* The user sets up an authentication factor, such as a password, for future entrance.
* The user returns to login and the system asks for the identification (username) and authentication factor (password).
* The system authenticates the user by verifying that the information is correct and matches what is stored.
* The user is granted access to systems and resources that the admin has authorized.
